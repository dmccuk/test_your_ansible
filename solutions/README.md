## Welcome to the levelX solutions
I'll be adding the best solutions created by you guys into this folder. It will give people a chance to see how they should be writing Ansible and help them improve their Ansible skills.

Once you have a solution, add it to your own GitHub page and send me the link. I'll clone it and run it against my servers to see if you pass.

Good Luck.
