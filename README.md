# Test your Ansible
This repo contains Ansible "Assert" tests. Can you work out what you need to do to pass the tests?

## What do you have to do?
Every month or so, I'll upload a new "test" file. It will contain assert tests that you will need to create an ansible playbook to pass. Some will be simple, others will be harder.

Think of this as a game. Can you write the ansible you need to pass the test?

## How will it work?
You need to clone the tests and run them on your server. The tests will fail (of course!). Then, write ansible code to pass the tests and let me know where your repo is so I can test it.

The best solution, will become the levelX champion and their solution will be added to the repo for everyone else to see how it's done.
